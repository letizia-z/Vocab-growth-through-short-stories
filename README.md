# How Many Words Can I Acquire From Consuming Content In L2

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook and supporting materials aimed at analyzing how much vocabulary learners can acquire by consuming content in a second language (L2), specifically English. The project focuses on evaluating the complexity and variety of vocabulary in selected short stories and estimating how effectively these texts contribute to vocabulary growth through passive exposure.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About the Project

The notebook is the result of a University project done by a beginner, performing linguistic analysis on three short stories by different authors, calculating metrics such as:

- Total sentences, words, and syllables  
- Flesch-Kincaid readability scores  
- Vocabulary variety and possible new words learned passively  

The goal is to better understand how consuming different types of texts might aid in language learning, particularly in overcoming the ‚Äúlanguage learning plateau.‚Äù

## ‚úÖ Contents

- Jupyter Notebook with analysis and code  
- Text files of the selected short stories  
- (Future) Visualizations and additional resources

## üîÑ Current Status

This repository is a work in progress. I am still finishing the translation of my notes and explanations from Italian to English. As such, the content is not yet complete, but I wanted to share it publicly to gather feedback and continue development openly.

## üîó Requirements

- Python 3.x  
- `spaCy` with the English model  
- `spacy_syllables` package (for syllable counting)  
- Other dependencies as listed in the notebook
